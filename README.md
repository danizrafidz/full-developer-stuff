# ROADMAP TO FULL STACK DEVELOPER
---
This repository is used to document my journey on getting a better foundational knowledge of Full Stack Developer. I will be starting this journey on the 1st July 2022 but the idea is that we take 180 days which just so happens to be July 1st to December 31st.

The reason for documenting these days is so that others can take something from it and also hopefully enhance the resources.

The goal is to take 180 days, 3 hours a day at least, to tackle over major areas of Full Stack Developer to a foundational knowledge.

This will not cover all things Full Stack Developer but it will cover the areas that I feel will benefit my learning and understanding overall.
