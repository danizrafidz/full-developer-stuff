0. Which programming language to learn?
- Learn Python, JavaScript since it's a good investment easy and invtuitive to write (not C++, Java or low language) cuz it's versatile and have many applications in career

## 5 WAYS ZERO TO HERO
### 1. THE BEST PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
- JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS
- Framework: React, View, Angular, NodeJs
### 2. GETTING STARTED
- Coding every single day without exception, 5 minutes minimum, or start small if you can't constantly
- SAY IT LOUD "I am going to use every free moment I have to learn this new thing"

- What matters is the amount of time you sit down and actually write code constantly 
- Code, Compile, Code, Compile, Code, Compile...
### 3. IMITATE
- Find someone to learn from (could be mentor)

#### Youtube learn:
- Copy their tutorials
- Line for line
- Be curious
- Read, Search, Ask

### 4. INNOVATE
- Build your portofolio
- More crucial if you're self-taught programmer
### 5. MARKET
  - You have been locked in your room for six months with minimal contact from the outside world
  - It's time to put yourself out there (Maybe hardest part for some people)
  - Build LinkedIn, Post cringy programming motivation
  - Message people, talk to people, make friends in the industry
  - Messages recruiters
  - Appy for every job you can, regardless of the requirements
  - Go to programming meetups
  - Network with people, THIS IS EXTREMELY CRUCIAL
  - Get jobs interviews, BOMB JOB INTERVIEWS, a lot of them learn from your interview
  - Sharpen the areas you need to sharpen
  - Getting your foot in the door somewhere is the final step in your ticket to making this your career

## 3 MAJOR MISTAKES THAT CAN SLOW DOWN YOUR PROGRESS TO BECOME FULL STACK
### 1. WATCH OTHERS
- YOU SHOULD LEARN BY CODING, NOT WATCH OTHERS DOING CODING (Like Udemy has 64 hours, in fact they never end up finishing the course)

- https://learnpython.org/ and JUST FOCUS ON BASIC LESSONS ON WEBSITE and DON'T WORRY ABOUT DATA SCIENCE TUTORIALS or MORE ADVANCED TUTORIALS
  - Cuz you would not be able to remember them until you have actually applied them on a real world problem
  - STEP BY STEP in conclusion
  - WORKING ON BUILDING YOUR OWN PROJECTS WILL HELP YOU IN MULTIPLE WAYS (Just like me when I made google sheet projects lol)
  - "Day a life of a Full Stack Developer looks like" : You will write code that will fail and you'll debug it and repeat it over and over again.
  - Build projects for PORTOFOLIO, host your code on github and put the link in your resume

  - What kind of projects should I work on??? (My Question)
    - find projects that you find interesting
    - FOR EXAMPLE: Web Crawler, Alarm Clock, App that gives you Wikipedia article of the day
    - ADVANCED PROJECTS : Spam Filter, Algorithmic Trading Engine, E-Commerce Website
  - Now you have a great portofolio/resume and you are confident about your programming skills
### 2. NO INTERBIEW PREP
- How to prepare for interviews?
- Usually Data Structures and Algorithms
- Google Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms in Udacity, Be Regular and finish this course
- THINGS YOU NEED:
  - Make sure you take small steps everyday and make regular progress
  - Make sure you complete all the exercises they give in this course
- After you finish All, now you have all the foundational knowledge you need to tackle the interviews
  - In order to sharpen your interview skills further
  - You need to practice some questions that have been asked by tech companies in the past
  - BEST OF THE BEST : Use website called [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), so you will get interview style questions
  - All questions are tagged easy, medium, or hard based on difficulty
### 3. QUIT EARLY
- Because they overthink and complicate the interview process after every rejection
- "Do your best to crack the interviews but try to be detached from the outcome of the interviews"
