# 01 Data Visualization with D3

D3, or D3.js, stands for Data Driven Documents. It's a JavaScript library for creating dynamic and interactive data visualizations in the browser.

D3 is built to work with common web standards â€“ namely HTML, CSS, and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).

D3 supports many different kinds of input data formats. Then, using its powerful built-in methods, you can transform those data into different charts, graphs, and maps.

In the Data Visualization with D3 courses, you'll learn how to work with data to create different charts, graphs, hover elements, and other ingredients to create dynamic and attractive data visualizations.
